N3DPS Covid-19 response FAQ1.Introductiona.Who is N3DPS ?The National 3D Printing Society is a registered social enterprise with the goal of connecting likeminded societies to allow cooperation and help expand the field of student 3D printing. Webelieve 3D printing is a technology that all students should have access to in some form and wewant to help facilitate starting more 3D printing societies around the UK.Because of the current pandemic, the NHS is in crisis. Over the last few weeks we've all seenthe shocking news about shortages of protective equipment in health care services. TheNational 3D Printing Society are a collaborative of people and organisations with 3D printersspread across the country who are trying the best to help.b.How does N3DPS initiative work ?People who can assist will get an initial approval (see below for details). Approved members willbe printing and sending their prints to an approved medical company we are working with. Themedical company will sterilise the printed mounts, assemble it with the visors and send it to NHSpersonnel who need it. Our goal beside providing PPE for our NHS is to avoid face-to-facedrop-offs that could compromise health of everyone involved and also make sure that theproducts are sterilised and sent by an already established medical supplies provider.2.For Makers who have access to 3D printera.I have a printer and want to help, what are the steps ?1_ Read our Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) found in this ​link​ or in #Start-herechannel in ​Slack​.2_ Download ​.STL​.3_ Get initial approval by sharing picture of one printed STL design in the#approvalpicture channel of Slack. This is the ​link​ to join the Slack. If you cannot find the#approvalpicture channel, click on + sign on the left > Browse Channels > then join#approvalpicture4_ Await approval and check for email from admin for the next steps.
