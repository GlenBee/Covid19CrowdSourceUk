# Face shields for NHS staff.

Two main initiatives exist. Both involve 3D printing a face shield mount, with a plastic, transparent sheet then added.
Plastic sheets are from readily available office supplies.
Attachment involves using a hole punch on the plastic sheet, the holes then line up with mounting points on the visor.
